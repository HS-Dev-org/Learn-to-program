# Variable 

 

We will first start by creating a string variable like this 

```csharp 
string chain = Console.ReadLine();
``` 

The string variable will ask you what you want to write and will therefore write it

Then write what you wrote.

```csharp 
string chain = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine(chain);
```
