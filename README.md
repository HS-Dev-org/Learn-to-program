# Variable 

 

We will first start by creating a string variable like this 

```csharp 
string chain = Console.ReadLine();
``` 

And will write it

```csharp 
string chain = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine(chain);
``` 

The string variable will ask you what you want to write and will therefore write it
