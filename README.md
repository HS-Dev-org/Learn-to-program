# Variable (string)

 

We will first start by creating a string variable like this 

```csharp 
string chain = Console.ReadLine();
``` 

And will write it

```csharp 
string chain = Console.ReadLine();

Console.WriteLine(chain);
``` 

The string variable will ask you what you want to write and will therefore write it

# Variable (int)

The int variable is used for numbers, written as a string except that you are going to put a number. that gives us that

```chsarp
int number = 3;
```

and

```chsarp
int number = 3;
Console.WriteLine(number);
```

# Variable (bool)

The Boolean variable is a variable of truths. it's close to the conditions, Like this :
```csharp
bool the_meal_is_good = true;

if (the_meal_is_good)
{
    Console.WriteLine("The meal must have been delicious");
}


```

# Condition (if)

Conditions are written like this

```csharp
string stan = Console.ReadLine();

if (stan == "Stanley")
{
   Console.WriteLine("Stanley is the best programmer, better than zellidev");
}
```
